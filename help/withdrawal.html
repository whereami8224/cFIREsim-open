<h4>Withdrawal Strategy</h4>

                    <p>There are MANY withdrawal strategies out there, and
                        cFIREsim attempts to capture just a few of the more relevant ones. If you have a suggestion for
                        a withdrawal strategy that should be implemented as a cFIREsim Spending Plan please <a

                        <ul>
                        <li><b>Inflation Adjusted:</b> This increases your spending each year by the amount of inflation
                            indicated in the Inflation Assumptions section on the sidebar. This means that your
                            "spending power" remains the same throughout retirement. By default, Inflation Assumptions
                            is set to use the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for it's calculations, which is the generally
                            accepted rule-of-thumb for inflation.</li>
                        <li><b>Not Inflation Adjusted:</b> This leaves your spending at the same value as you put in the
                            Yearly Spending input. This means that as the prices of goods gets higher and higher, your
                            spending will never go up to match that price increase.</li>
                        <li><b>% of Portfolio:</b> This calculates your spending each year based on the value of your
                            portfolio. The default option is a Constant % which means that it will take that same
                            percentage out of your portfolio each year (in nominal dollars), regardless of market
                            conditions. If you choose Floor and Ceiling Values, you will be given the option to set
                            limits to the yearly spending calculation. These floor/ceiling values are based on
                            inflation-adjusted (according to your Inflation Assumptions in the sidebar) percentages of
                            the initial portfolio at retirement. Example: With $1M portfolio, you can specify a 4%
                            nominal withdrawal rate, with a 3.5% floor and 5% ceiling. This means that with
                            market/inflation fluctuations, your spending will never dip below $35k/yr
                            (inflation-adjusted) and never go above $50k/yr (inflation-adjusted). Another option for the
                            Floor Spending is % of Previous Year. This is based on Robert Clyatt's 95% rule, but gives
                            you the freedom to choose the value. This option states that if the market dips enough to
                            cause your yearly spending to dip, it will never be less than 95% (or whatever you enter) of
                            the previous year's spending value. This limits wild fluctuations. (Example: $1M Portfolio,
                            4% spending, floor of 95% previous year. If in year 2, your portfolio drops to $800k, 4%
                            would only be $32,000 in spending. However, the floor rule would set your spending to no
                            less than $40,000 * 95% = $38,000).</li>
                        <li><b>Hebeler Autopilot Method:</b> is based on <a
                                href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/put-retirement-savings-withdrawals-on-autopilot-2013-07-24">Henry
                                Hebeler's Autopilot Method Article</a>. This Method is a blend between "Inflation
                            Adjusted Spending" and the Required Minimum Distribution Method (RMD). This method provides
                            an inflation-adjusted spending that also corresponds to your longevity expectation. Your Age
                            at Retirement input helps to determine your RMD calculations. The final yearly spending is
                            an average between the 2 methods, and you can choose the weight that each method has on your
                            spending calculations by changing the percentage values.</li>
                        <li><b>Variable Spending:</b> allows for small deviations in spending within those values when
                            the market dictates it. The Z-value determines how much your spending changes during the
                            market changes. The method then tracks an inflation-adjusted version of your Spending
                            amount. Example: If your portfolio is up 10%, Z-value is 0.5, and Spending was $40k, your
                            new spending is now (1+(10% * 0.5)) * $40k = (1.05)*40k = $42000. Example2: If your
                            portfolio then is down 25%, Z-value is still 0.5, Spending was $42000, your new spending is
                            now (1-(25% * 0.5)) * $42k = (0.875)*42000 = your $36750. So, the z-value just provides a
                            value of how much your spending reacts to your portfolio health. If the Z-value is lower,
                            your spending swings less. If it is higher, it swings more. Add in the universal Spending
                            Floor/Ceiling for guardrails, and you've got yourself a pretty good spending method.</li>
                        <li><b>Guyton-Klinger Method:</b> This method is a hybrid of adjusting your spending by
                            inflation and the 4% rule, with additional rules regarding bull/bear markets. It was
                            developed by a pair of economists (Guyton and Klinger). <a

                                read their paper on the method before using this option.</a> It properly defines the
                            rules of the withdrawals. Note: The Guyton-Klinger "Initial Withdrawal Rate" is based on
                            your Yearly Spending Input and the amount of your portfolio at the time of retirement, not a
                            static %.</li>
                        <li><b>VPW Method:</b> A mix of the constant-dollar and constant-percentage methods, with the
                            goal of spending down your nest-egg nearly completely before the end. <a
                                href="https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=120430">Proposed and
                                developed by longinvest on the Bogleheads Forums.</a> Your yearly spending is entirely
                            calculated based on your portfolio at retirement and the number of years that you're in
                            retirement, along with some factors of asset allocation.</li>
                        <li><b>Variable CAPE Method:</b> <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclically_adjusted_price-to-earnings_ratio">CAPE
                                (Cyclically-adjusted price-to-earning ratio)</a> is a valuation measure usually applied
                            to the US S&P 500 equity market. It is defined as price divided by the average of ten years
                            of earnings (moving average), adjusted for inflation. The CAPE method adjusts your
                            retirement based on this valuation of the market (spending more in the boom times, and less
                            in the down times). Example for how spending is calculated in a given year: Spending will
                            always equal (spendingRate = currentCAPEYield * multiplier + constantAdjustment). If we're
                            in a year where the CAPE is 17.48, currentCAPEYield will equal 1/17.48 or 0.0572. If you
                            kept the the defaults inputs, the "constantAdjustment" would equal 1/100 or .01. So, for
                            that given year, your spending rate would be adjusted to 0.0572 * 0.5 + .01 = 0.0386 (or
                            3.86% withdrawal rate). So if your portfolio happened to be $1M at the time, you'd withdraw
                            $38,600.</li>
